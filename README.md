CodeQL is the analysis engine used by developers to automate security checks, and by security researchers to perform variant analysis. \
I wrote a script for easy use of codeql that automatically builds and analyzes the database by filling in the config section.  

## usage:
1-setup file is for download and setup codeql and query. \
2- codeqlrunner for analyzes source code. You need fill configure section and run it.

## note:
in setup file,Check last version.When I write script last vesion is V2.5.8.
